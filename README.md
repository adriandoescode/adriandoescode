# Hi, I'm Adrian Krzysiak ðŸ‘‹

I am a proud future student in Computer Engineering at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC).

As of now, actively developing my technical skills in languages like Python, Swift, and Java, and I have hands-on experience with the Apple Vision Framework from my project I am currently working on, Kard Agent: A PokÃ©mon Portfolio Tracker.

At the moment, I am seeking internship opportunities for Summer 2026 where I can contribute to a team and apply my problem-solving skills to real-world engineering challenges. I'm always open to connecting with professionals and students in the field, feel free to reach out!
